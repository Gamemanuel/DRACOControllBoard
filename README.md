## Description of my Project:
this is a PCB that i created for my robotics teams t-shirt cannon project. this was my first time using KICAD and i learned alot from making this PCB
## list of materials that i used
RASBERRIE PI PICO x1 i needed USB support and i looked into doing it with transistors but that got complicated fast
Buttons x12 ( i know that i only get 10 so i plan on getting an extra 2 )
LED x6 these are indicator LEDS for when the cannon is ready to fire.
